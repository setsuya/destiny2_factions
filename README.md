# Destiny 2 Faction Checker

**The project is being hosted [here](https://setsuya.github.io/destiny2_factions) using *GitHub Pages*.**

### About
Now in Destiny 2 we have lots of factions that we can level with materials and tokens and no easy way to see our standing with them unless we visit every single one to check. This can be tedious and time consuming, so I decided to take this load off my shoulders.
This faction checker lists all available factions in the game and your characters' current standing with them. It also shows the available amount of experience for each one from the materials you are currently carrying. Now if you have sufficient materials to get a level up engram with any faction this will highlight it for you so you can choose to go to the specific representative to get your rewards.

### How to
- Choose network(XBOX or PS currently);
- Input user name;
- If found, a list of characters will be shown with basic information;
- Select one of the characters;
- List of factions and that character's current standing with them along clan rewards and contributed experience for the selected character will be shown;

If you have items you can turn in they will be shown as a percentage in green in each faction's experience bar. The list can update by itself every 5 minutes if you choose to. You can refresh it manually or automatically with the buttons before the faction list.
