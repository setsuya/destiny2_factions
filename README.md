# Destiny 2 Faction Checker

**The project is being hosted [here](https://setsuya.github.io/destiny2_factions) using *GitHub Pages*.**

### About
Now in Destiny 2 we have lots of factions that we can level with materials and tokens and no easy way to see our standing with them unless we visit every single one to check. This can be tedious and time consuming, so I decided to take this load off my shoulders.

This faction checker lists all available factions in the game and your characters' current standing with them. It also shows the available amount of experience for each one from the materials you are currently carrying. Now if you have sufficient materials to get a level up engram with any faction this will highlight it for you so you can choose to go to the specific representative to get your rewards.

The project now evolved to also show your available clan rewards and your weekly XP contribution to your clan alongside your available milestones. Since now a lot more information is shown at the same time, you can choose which sections you want to show or hide by clicking their titles. When hidden, each section will still have a one-line summary along with its title showing relevant information.

Language can be toggled between English or Brazilian Portuguese *(for now; you can read about how you can help me expand these options [down below](https://github.com/setsuya/destiny2_factions#contributing-to-the-project))* by clicking the flag at the top right of the page.

### How to
- Choose network(XBOX, PS or BLIZZARD);
- Input user name;
- If found, a list of characters will be shown with basic information;
- Select one of the characters;
- List of factions and that character's current standing with them, clan rewards and contributed experience and available milestones progression for the selected character will be shown;

If you have items you can turn in they will be shown as a percentage in green in each faction's experience bar. The list can update by itself every 5 minutes if you choose to. You can refresh it manually or automatically with the buttons below the character list.

### Contributing to the project
If you want to see this tool available in one of the other languages Destiny 2 is available in, I hang out a lot on the Destiny 2 subreddit. You can send me a message there through [this link](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Setsuya_&subject=Destiny%202%20Faction%20Checker%20Translation) or check my email on my [Github profile](https://github.com/setsuya) if Reddit is not your thing to offer to help me translate this into other languages.
